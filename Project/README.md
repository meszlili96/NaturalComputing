# EvolutionaryGAN

Code based on paper available at [https://github.com/WANG-Chaoyue/EvolutionaryGAN-pytorch](https://github.com/WANG-Chaoyue/EvolutionaryGAN-pytorch)

### Useful literatire:
 - Generative adversarial nets - the paper which first describes GANs
 - Generalization and equilibrium in generative adversarial nets (GANs) - mode collapse description
 - Unsupervised representation learning with deep convolutional generative adversarial networks - describes the DCGANs archeticture which is used in the paper
 - Least squares generative adversarial networks - describes least-squares mutation
 - Unrolled generative adversarial networks - describes the simulated data used in the paper
 - Evolving deep neural networks - an example of evolutionary computations application (given in the paper and also on Elena's slide)
 - Evolving artificial neural networks - seems to be one of the olders papers about the topic
 - Energy-based generative adversarial network - an example of GANs with objective function that make training more stable
 - Wasserstein generative adversarial networks - GANs with another more robust objective function (WGAN)
 - Improved training of wasserstein gans - desciption of WGAN-GP
