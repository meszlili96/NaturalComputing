# EvolutionaryGAN

The implementation is based on the paper [https://github.com/WANG-Chaoyue/EvolutionaryGAN-pytorch](https://github.com/WANG-Chaoyue/EvolutionaryGAN-pytorch)
 
The organisation of the repository is the following:

- **EvolutionaryGAN** folder contains the cource code.
- **EvolutionaryGAN/scripts** folder contains the shell scripts that can be used to run GAN training.
- **Gamma comparison eval metrics** folder contains the plots of all evaluation metrics for simulated data saved for gammas which produced the best KDEs. These are the same plots as included into the report.
- **GANs comparison eval metrics** folder contains the plots of all evaluation metrics for simulated data  saved for the compared GANs. These are the same plots as included into the report.
- **literature** folder contains the literature we worked with.
- **Loss functions illustration.png** plot of the loss function used in the implementation made to ensure the correctness of the implementation.
- **Diversity score function visualisation.png** plot of the diversity score used in the implementation made to ensure the correctness of the implementation.
- **sim_distr.png** plots of PDEs and scatter plots for the sample of size 10000 for simulated data disctributions.

The results of all our experimenst can be found in [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FXKlqFchWaDg0Ha_1QYMNOv1npS3F5Jr?usp=sharing). The titles of the folders and file names are self-explanatory.
