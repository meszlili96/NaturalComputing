The best discrimination of all the languages is with r = 3
hiligaynon - AUC = 0.839741935483871
middle-english - AUC = 0.5424193548387097
plautdietsch - AUC = 0.7746774193548387
xhosa AUC = 0.8893387096774196

The results are sensible - it is hardly possible to discriminate English and middle-english, plautdietsch is from the same language family, hiligaynon could have some influence from European languages because of colonisation history (or other reasons, haven't had much time to check). xhosa is the most different and it is from South Africa
